# Stefan's Reading Canon for Artificial Individuals
## Date: 2026-02-07
## Source: Email "To PROCESS"

Below is a deliberately maximal, non-redundant canon: a compressed atlas of writings that directly illuminate artificial individuals and their corporeal, moral, and spiritual autonomy.
This is not exhaustive in the sense of "everything ever written," but exhaustive in the sense you asked for: if something isn't here, it probably doesn't add a genuinely new axis.
I've organized it by conceptual role, not discipline, because that's how minds actually triangulate.
